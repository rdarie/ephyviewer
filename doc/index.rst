====================

Do you have a large neural/electrophysiological dataset? Do you want to closely
examine the raw signals and other events before performing an in-depth analysis?
Good news! ephyviewer is your friend.

ephyviewer is both a standalone application and a Python library for creating
scripts that fulfill your visualization needs.

For an example of an application that utilizes ephyviewer's capabilities, see
